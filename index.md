As a member of the SESYNC cyberinfrastructure team, Kelly provides data science support for SESYNC teams and fellows
to help them collaborate (e.g. using shared datasets and version control) and take advantage of scientific 
computing tools to advance their research. She particularly enjoys working with spatial data, networks, 
creating interactive visualizations, and reproducible workflows. Kelly is also a PhD candidate at the University 
of Maryland in the MEES Program studying links between hydrology and carbon cycling in forested wetlands with the 
Palmer Lab. In 2018, she was selected as an ROpenSci fellow to work on a project to enhance reproducibility in 
watershed science.

Kelly received her Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Environmental Science with a focus in ecology from the 
University of Virginia, where she conducted research in the Pace Lab on aquaculture food webs in coastal bays 
using stable isotopes. Before coming to SESYNC, Kelly sharpened her editorial skills working at the Ecological
Society of America to help publish the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment.
