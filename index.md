Kelly is a postdoc at the [National Ecological Observatory Network](https://www.neonscience.org/), working on models to characterize inland waters by integrating airborne and aquatic data streams. Her research combines interests in aquatic biogeochemistry, water resources, and data science.

Kelly received her Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Environmental Science with a focus in ecology from the University of Virginia, where she conducted research in the [Pace Lab](https://pace.evsc.virginia.edu/) on aquaculture food webs in coastal bays using stable isotopes. Her PhD research at the University of Maryland explored the links between hydrology and methane emissions in forested wetlands.
