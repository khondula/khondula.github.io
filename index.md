Kelly is a PhD candidate at the University of Maryland in the [MEES Program](https://www.mees.umd.edu/) studying links between hydrology and carbon cycling in forested wetlands with the [Palmer Lab](https://palmerlab.umd.edu/). In 2018, she was selected as an [rOpenSci fellow](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/02/14/announcing-2018-ropensci-fellows/) to work on a project to enhance reproducibility in watershed science.

As a member of the [SESYNC](https://www.sesync.org/) cyberinfrastructure team, Kelly provides data science support for research teams and fellows to help them collaborate (e.g. using shared datasets and version control) and take advantage of scientific computing tools to advance their research. She particularly enjoys working with spatial data, networks, 
creating interactive visualizations, and reproducible workflows. 

Kelly received her Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Environmental Science with a focus in ecology from the 
University of Virginia, where she conducted research in the [Pace Lab](https://pace.evsc.virginia.edu/) on aquaculture food webs in coastal bays using stable isotopes. Before coming to SESYNC, Kelly sharpened her editorial skills working at the Ecological Society of America to help publish the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment.
