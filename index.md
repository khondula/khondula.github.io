🏞️  Kelly Hondula’s research focuses on the effects of water movement through landscapes, with an emphasis on improving water resource management and new monitoring technologies. She studies the interaction of hydrological and biogeochemical processes, especially in headwaters and the smallest water bodies.

🛩 🗺 🔬    Hondula is currently a postdoc at the [National Ecological Observatory Network](https://www.neonscience.org/), studying new techniques for mapping aquatic ecosystems and water quality by integrating airborne and ground-based aquatic data. 

👩‍💻    In her previous role at the [National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center](https://www.SESYNC.org/), Hondula served on a small team of data scientists supporting diverse computational and analytical needs of interdisciplinary research teams. 

🏆   Her work promoting open science has been supported by the WikiMedia foundation and a data science fellowship from the non-profit organization rOpenSci. 

👩‍🎓   Hondula received her doctorate in Marine, Estuarine and Environmental Sciences at the University of Maryland and holds undergraduate and master’s degrees in Environmental Sciences from the University of Virginia.
